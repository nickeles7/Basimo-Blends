## About Labneh

Labneh is a Middle Eastern strained yogurt cheese that's incredibly creamy and tangy. If you can't find it, you can make your own by straining Greek yogurt overnight through cheesecloth.

## The Perfect Za'atar

Our organic za'atar blend adds the perfect finishing touch with its blend of thyme, sesame seeds, sumac, and other premium ingredients. The tangy, earthy flavor complements the creamy labneh beautifully.

*This recipe serves 4 as an appetizer or 2 as a light meal. Perfect for entertaining!*
