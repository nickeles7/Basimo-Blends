# Perfect Za'atar Roasted Chicken Recipe

This aromatic roasted chicken showcases the incredible flavor of our organic za'atar blend. The combination of herbs, sesame seeds, and sumac creates a crispy, flavorful crust that will make this your new favorite dinner recipe.

## Ingredients

- 1 whole chicken (3-4 lbs)
- 3 tbsp Basimo Blends Organic Za'atar
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 lemon (juiced and zested)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 1 onion, quartered
- Fresh herbs for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Preheat your oven** to 425째F (220째C).

2. **Prepare the chicken** by patting it dry with paper towels. This ensures crispy skin.

3. **Make the za'atar paste** by mixing our organic za'atar with olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, and minced garlic.

4. **Season the chicken** generously with salt and pepper, then rub the za'atar paste all over the skin and inside the cavity.

5. **Stuff the cavity** with quartered onion and any remaining lemon halves.

6. **Roast for 60-75 minutes** until the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C).

7. **Rest for 10 minutes** before carving.

## Chef's Tips

- For extra crispy skin, let the seasoned chicken sit uncovered in the refrigerator for 2-4 hours before roasting
- Save the pan drippings to make a delicious gravy
- Serve with roasted vegetables tossed in our za'atar blend

## The Magic of Our Za'atar

Our organic za'atar blend features hand-selected thyme, sesame seeds, sumac, and other premium ingredients that create layers of flavor - earthy, tangy, and aromatic all at once.
